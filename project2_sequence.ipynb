Many NLP tasks have this general form. Most famously is the task of _part-of-speech labeling_ as you explored in lab 2-4, where the tokens in a text are to be labeled with their part of speech (noun, verb, preposition, etc.). In this project segment, however, you'll use sequence labeling to implement a system for filling the slots in a template that is intended to describe the meaning of an ATIS query. For instance, the sentence \n", "\n", "    What's the earliest arriving flight between Boston and Washington DC?\n", "    \n", "might be associated with the following slot-filled template: \n", "\n", "    flight_id\n", "        fromloc.cityname: boston\n", "        toloc.cityname: washington\n", "        toloc.state: dc\n", "        flight_mod: earliest arriving\n", "    \n", "You may wonder how this task is a sequence labeling task. We label each word in the source sentence with a tag taken from a set of tags that correspond to the slot-labels. For each slot-label, say `flight_mod`, there are two tags: `B-flight_mod` and `I-flight_mod`. These are used to mark the beginning (B) or interior (I) of a phrase that fills the given slot. In addition, there is a tag for other (O) words that are not used to fill any slot. (This technique is thus known as IOB encoding.) Thus the sample sentence would be labeled as follows:\n", "\n", "| Token   | Label    |\n", "| :------ | :----- | \n", "| `BOS` | `O` |\n", "| `what's` | `O` |\n", "| `the` | `O` |\n", "| `earliest` | `B-flight_mod` |\n", "| `arriving` | `I-flight_mod` |\n", "| `flight` | `O` |\n", "| `between` | `O` |\n", "| `boston` | `B-fromloc.city_name` |\n", "| `and` | `O` |\n", "| `washington` | `B-toloc.city_name` |\n", "| `dc` | `B-toloc.state_code` |\n", "| `EOS` | `O` |\n", "\n", "> See below for information about the `BOS` and `EOS` tokens. \n", "\n", "The template itself is associated with the question type for the sentence, perhaps as recovered from the sentence in the last project segment.\n", "\n", "In this segment, you'll implement three methods for sequence labeling: a hidden Markov model (HMM) and two recurrent neural networks, a simple RNN and a long short-term memory network (LSTM).
